# Depression_Analysis
Depression is the leading cause of suicide worldwide and many a times this mental condition gets reflected through social media post. Currently working on this project wherein twitter data was collected through specific keywords and compiled into two datasets- depressed and control. This was analyzed for specific linguistic markers through building a deep learning model which could then be used for identifying the deteriorating mental condition in case of depression.
