# Depression_Analysis
Depression is the leading cause of suicide worldwide and many a times this mental condition gets reflected through social media post. Currently working on this project wherein twitter data was collected through specific keywords and compiled into two datasets- depressed and control. This was analyzed for specific linguistic markers, time and frequency of posting of tweets through building a deep learning model which could then be used for identifying the deteriorating mental condition in case of depression.
For data collection it was specifically found that the data extraction process using twitter API was slow. Maximum allowed count of tweets are 100 and that historical tweets were not accessible. Therefore used an alternate tool to get huge amount of historical tweets, which was the modified GetOldTweets-python tool originally developed by Jefferson Henrique and later modified by Victor E. Irekponor. Github link for the same- https://github.com/marquisvictor/Optimized-Modified-GetOldTweets3-OMGOT.git.
After data collection, preprocessing of the text data was the next step. These steps were done using the libraries associated with nltk package in python.
